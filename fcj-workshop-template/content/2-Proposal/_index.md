# AWS BILLO

## A Serverless Digital Wallet and Store Management System on AWS

### 1. Executive Summary

AWS BILLO is a serverless digital wallet and store management system developed during the internship period. The project was designed to demonstrate how AWS cloud services can be used to build a modern application that combines an internal demonstration wallet, merchant POS, table ordering, QR payment, and store management.

The system supports three main roles: Customer, Merchant, and Admin. Customers can register with a phone number, verify OTP, log in, manage a demonstration wallet, transfer money, scan QR codes, order products at a table, make QR payments, and view transaction history. Merchants can register their business, manage store information, products or services, tables, orders, bills, and QR payment sessions. Admins can review merchant applications, approve or reject business registrations, and assign merchant permissions.

The project uses a cost-optimized serverless architecture on AWS. The main AWS services include Amazon Cognito, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS SAM, and AWS CloudFormation. The frontend is developed using Flutter and is designed to support both web and mobile interfaces.

The main purpose of AWS BILLO is not to build a production financial system, but to create a practical MVP that demonstrates cloud-native application design, serverless backend development, role-based access control, QR-based workflows, and AWS service integration.

### 2. Problem Statement

#### What’s the Problem?

Many small stores, coffee shops, and food service businesses still manage products, tables, orders, bills, and payments using manual processes or separate tools. This can create several problems:

- Orders may be recorded manually and can be lost or duplicated.
- Table orders are difficult to track when customers order multiple times.
- Customers need to wait for staff to view the menu, order products, or request a bill.
- Store information, product images, and business documents may be stored inconsistently.
- Payment information is not always clearly connected to the related order or bill.
- Customers cannot easily review what they paid for after a transaction.
- Merchants need a simple system to manage stores, products, services, tables, and orders.
- Admins need a clear workflow to review and approve merchant registration applications.
- Existing POS and wallet systems may be too complex or costly for small businesses and student learning projects.

#### The Solution

AWS BILLO provides a unified application that combines wallet features, QR payment, store management, and POS functions in one system.

Customers can scan a QR code attached to a table, open the store menu, select products, and submit orders. The system remembers the active table, so customers can reopen the same table session without scanning the QR code again.

Merchants can view the current bill of each table, add or remove items, update the bill, and generate a payment QR code. Customers scan the payment QR code using the BILLO application and confirm the transaction.

After a successful payment, the order is marked as paid, transaction records are created, and the active table is removed from the customer account. To start a new table session, the customer must scan a new table QR code.

Amazon Cognito handles user registration, OTP confirmation, login, and role-based access control. Amazon API Gateway protects backend APIs using JWT authorization. AWS Lambda processes business logic. Amazon DynamoDB stores application data. Amazon S3 stores business documents and product images.

#### Benefits and Return on Investment

AWS BILLO provides the following benefits:

- Reduces manual store and table management.
- Connects products, orders, bills, payments, and transaction history in one system.
- Allows customers to order from a table using QR code.
- Reduces repeated QR scanning during the same table session.
- Supports QR payment and cash payment workflows.
- Provides transaction and bill history for users.
- Uses serverless services without managing EC2 servers.
- Automatically scales based on actual usage.
- Uses pay-per-request services to reduce development and demonstration costs.
- Provides a practical environment for learning AWS serverless architecture.

For the internship project scope, AWS BILLO was developed as an MVP and demonstration system. The main value of the project is the practical experience gained from designing, implementing, testing, and documenting a serverless application on AWS.

### 3. Solution Architecture

AWS BILLO uses a serverless architecture deployed in the AWS Singapore Region: `ap-southeast-1`.

Flutter clients communicate with Amazon Cognito for authentication and Amazon API Gateway for protected business operations. API Gateway uses a Cognito JWT Authorizer to verify user identity before forwarding requests to AWS Lambda functions.

Lambda functions handle user profiles, merchant registration, admin approval, store management, product management, table management, orders, bills, payment sessions, wallet transfers, transaction history, and file upload workflows.

Amazon DynamoDB stores profiles, wallets, merchants, stores, products, tables, active table sessions, orders, payment sessions, and transactions. Amazon S3 stores business licenses, store images, and product images using pre-signed URLs. Amazon CloudWatch collects Lambda logs and supports troubleshooting.

The architecture does not require Amazon EC2, custom VPC, NAT Gateway, or RDS because the system is designed around fully managed serverless services.

### 6. Budget Estimation

The project uses pay-per-request serverless services. Actual costs depend on the number of users, API requests, OTP messages, stored images, data transfer, and CloudWatch Logs.

A demonstration scenario may include:

- Fewer than 100 monthly active users.
- Approximately 10,000 API requests per month.
- Fewer than 100,000 Lambda executions per month.
- Less than 1 GB of DynamoDB data.
- Less than 2 GB of S3 images and documents.
- Limited Flutter Web traffic.
- A small number of verified SMS OTP destinations.

#### Estimated Infrastructure Costs

- **AWS Lambda**: Expected to remain within the free or very low-cost usage range for demonstration traffic.

- **Amazon API Gateway HTTP API**: Approximately $0.01–$0.05 per month for a small number of requests.

- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Approximately $0.10–$1.00 per month with low on-demand read/write usage.

- **Amazon S3**: Approximately $0.05–$0.50 per month for a small image and document collection.

- **Amazon Cognito**: Expected to have low or no user-pool cost for a small number of monthly active users. SMS delivery is charged separately.

- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Approximately $0.00–$1.00 per month when log volume and retention are controlled.

- **Frontend Hosting**: Approximately $1.00–$5.00 per month depending on hosting, build frequency, storage, and traffic.

- **SMS OTP**: Variable cost based on the destination country, message count, and AWS messaging configuration.

#### Estimated Total

- Backend demonstration environment: approximately **$1–$5 per month**, excluding SMS OTP.
- Backend with Flutter Web hosting: approximately **$2–$10 per month**, excluding SMS OTP.
- Development may remain near zero when AWS credits or eligible free-tier allowances are available.

These values are preliminary estimates and should be verified using the AWS Pricing Calculator before production deployment.
